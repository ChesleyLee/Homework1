## Introduction

This document provides a plot based on a dataset from an R package.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this plot is the `ggplot2` package's `mpg` dataset. The `mpg` dataset contains observations collected by the *US Environmental Protection Agency* on *38* models of cars.

It includes variables such as *manufacturer*, *model*, *engine displacement*, *year*, *number of cylinders*, *transmission*, *drive type*, and *fuel economy (in city and highway driving).*

## Plot

Below is a scatter plot showing the relationship between engine displacement (in liters) and highway miles per gallon. We've added colors for each manufacturer and labels to make it visually appealing.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = manufacturer)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Engine Displacement vs. Highway MPG",
       subtitle = "Based on the mpg dataset from ggplot2 package",
       x = "Engine Displacement (L)",
       y = "Highway Miles per Gallon (MPG)",
       color = "Manufacturer") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14, color = "darkblue"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic", size = 12, color = "darkred"),
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 12),
    legend.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 12),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )

```

## Description of the Plot

### \textcolor{blue}{Overall Trend}

-   **Negative correlation:** Overall, highway MPG shows a decreasing trend with increasing engine displacement. This indicates that larger engines are generally less efficient and require more fuel.

### \textcolor{blue}{Anylasis of Manufactures}

-   **Manufacturer differences:** Different manufacturers have different MPG on the highway for the same engine displacement. For example, Toyota and Honda models exhibit higher MPG for smaller displacements (2-3 liters).

-   **Group Distribution:**

    -   *Toyota and Honda:* Mainly concentrated in the 2 to 3 liter displacement range, with higher MPG.

    -   *Ford and Chevrolet:* Covers a wide range of displacements, from less than 2 liters to close to 7 liters, with a wide MPG range.

    -   *Volkswagen:* Mainly concentrated in the displacement range of less than 3 liters, MPG performance is also relatively high.

### \textcolor{blue}{Conclusion}

-   According to the data, if consumers are concerned about fuel economy, they should consider choosing a model with a smaller displacement (2-3 liters) from Toyota or Honda.
